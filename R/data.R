#' @title Phase 2 Final Report: Incremental Sampling Visual Sample Plan Validation Study at Firing-Point Sally
#' @description The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate cost-effective statistical sampling techniques that can be used to confidently estimate the magnitude and extent of energetic compounds (i.e., explosives and propellants) within wide-area DUs when using ISMs.
